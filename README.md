# Word Guessing Game
### Instructions
This is a word guessing game, where you get 6 tries to guess the correct word.
After each word submission, you will be able to see if any letters are present in the word and whether or not they are in the right position:
- If the letter is part of the word and the letter is in the correct spot the tile becomes green
- If the letter is part of the word but the letter is not in the correct spot the tile becomes yellow
- If the letter is not part of the word, the letter becomes gray

You may choose whether the word contains 5 or 6 letters.
